** how to use make file
*** Create Makefile
*** Create None_Makefile
for example you name Mekfel, whichis cannot compiled automaticaly you should use 
make --file=Mekfel
** Using Emacs 
if you using emacs just M-x compile ret, and then emacs will show you make -k, after that you just type --filename=Mekfel, and then compiled.

** Including another makefile
maybe you wanna include some file like mantap.txt or mantap.mk, you can writeit. you will notice that .txt will not compiled, .mk will compiled. If you dont trust me you can try it with add some mk. like jiwa.mk 

if you not trust me you are right. because when compile like make --file=Mekfile mantaptxt. Its, succesfuly compiled.
